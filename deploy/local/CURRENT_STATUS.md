# Current Status of OpenCloud Without Reva

## What We've Accomplished

### âœ… Completed Implementation

1. **New API Layer** (`pkg/api/`)
   - Storage, Identity, Permissions, and Sharing interfaces
   - Common types that replace CS3 API
   - Clean, OpenCloud-specific design

2. **Service Runtime** (`pkg/runtime/`)
   - Lightweight service management
   - NATS integration
   - Health checking and graceful shutdown

3. **Storage Implementation** (`pkg/storage/decomposed/`)
   - Decomposed filesystem without Reva
   - Space management
   - Full CRUD operations

4. **Gateway** (`pkg/gateway/`)
   - Service discovery and routing
   - NATS-based communication

5. **Testing**
   - All new components have passing tests
   - Storage operations fully tested

### ðŸš§ Current Situation

The existing OpenCloud binary (`opencloud/bin/opencloud`) still uses Reva internally. Our new implementation exists alongside but isn't fully integrated into the main binary yet. This is why:

1. Running `opencloud server` still tries to start Reva-based services
2. The IDP service fails due to missing assets
3. Configuration still expects Reva components

### ðŸŽ¯ Demo Application

The demo (`cmd/demo-no-reva/main.go`) shows how the new components work together:

```bash
# Run the demo
cd /Users/felix/work/opencloud/deploy/local
./demo-standalone.sh
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080 to see:
- Working WebDAV endpoint
- Authentication without Reva
- Storage operations using new decomposed implementation

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps for Full Integration

1. **Service Migration**
   - Update each service to use new interfaces
   - Replace Reva imports with OpenCloud packages
   - Update service configurations

2. **Binary Integration**
   - Modify `opencloud/pkg/command/server.go` to use new runtime
   - Update service initialization
   - Remove Reva dependencies from build

3. **Configuration Migration**
   - Update config parser to handle new format
   - Provide migration tool for existing configs
   - Document configuration changes

## Testing the New Implementation

While the full integration is pending, you can test the new implementation:

### Option 1: Run the Demo

```bash
cd /Users/felix/work/opencloud/opencloud
go run cmd/demo-no-reva/main.go
```

- Visit http://localhost:8080
- Test WebDAV at http://localhost:8080/webdav/
- Use credentials: demo/demo or admin/admin

### Option 2: Use Components Directly

```go
// Example: Using storage directly
import (
    "github.com/opencloud-eu/opencloud/pkg/storage/decomposed"
)

storage, _ := decomposed.New("/tmp/storage")
// Use storage operations...
```

## Summary

The Reva-free implementation is complete and tested. The remaining work is integration into the main OpenCloud binary, which requires updating each service to use the new interfaces. The demo proves the concept works and provides a foundation for the migration.
